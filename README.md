# BattleShip

The game was developed as an exercise in a group of 3 during a course. 

It is a digital version of a battleship game. 

The aim of the project was to write a console version of the game using the Python language.

The project made it possible to use communication with the user via the keyboard and automatic validation of the data entered by the user. 

The player receives a graphical representation of the game state, together with hints when selecting ships on the board.

In the future, the project can be extended and the code extracted into separate files.  

The game is a backend application.
